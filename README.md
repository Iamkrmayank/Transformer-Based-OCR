Transformer-Based Optical Character Recognition(OCR)

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data.
OCR software analyzes the shapes, patterns, and arrangements of characters in a document and translates it into machine-encoded text.
This technology is particularly useful for digitizing printed documents so that the text can be edited, searched, and stored more efficiently.
