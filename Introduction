OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data.

OCR software analyzes the shapes, patterns, and arrangements of characters in a document and translates it into machine-encoded text. This technology is particularly useful for digitizing printed documents so that the text can be edited, searched, and stored more efficiently.

Applications of OCR include:

Document Digitization:

Converting physical documents into digital formats, making them easier to store, search, and retrieve.
Data Entry Automation:

Automating the process of entering data from paper documents into computer systems, reducing manual data entry errors and saving time.
Text Extraction from Images:

Extracting text from images, enabling the analysis of text data captured through photos or scanned images.
PDF Conversion:

Converting scanned PDFs or image-based PDFs into searchable and editable text documents.
Text-to-Speech Conversion:

Enabling the conversion of printed text into audio, making content accessible to visually impaired individuals.
Language Translation:

Facilitating the translation of printed or handwritten text into different languages.
Receipt and Invoice Processing:

Extracting information from receipts and invoices for expense tracking, accounting, and other financial processes.
Handwriting Recognition:

Recognizing and converting handwritten text into machine-encoded text.
Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR):

Identifying and extracting text information from license plates in images or video streams.
Forms Processing:

Extracting data from structured forms, such as surveys, questionnaires, and application forms.
